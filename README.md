This is Web app based on MERN stack called Exercise tracker.
This is a simple app where you can add users and keep record of the exercises
along with date and time. This app has very Excellent UI along with Bootstrap.
The DataBase is stored Online i.e Mongo DB Atlas.

TO run this Project you need to run 2 commands :
1) npm start (To start react-app).
2) nodemon server (To run Backend).

Thanks alot
Hope you Liked it :)


******IMPORTANT******
Please ignore the backend file. The actual backend folder is backends folder. Rename backends into backend and delete backend file.
Moreover install node_modules into new backend folder by just running command npm install.
